### 🧩 Functional & UI Requirements

1. **UI Design Reference**  
   - Use the **attached image** as the foundation for the layout.  
   - Support two interface modes:  
     - **Desktop View**
     - **Mobile View** (hamburger-style menu for navigation)

2. **Live Markdown Preview**  
   - Implement real-time rendering of Markdown content in the **output tab** as the user types in the **editor tab**.

3. **Theme Toggle**  
   - Include a switch between **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode**.
   - Dark mode must apply to both the **editor** and **output** areas (preferably styled similar to **GitHub's dark theme**).

4. **Editor Design**  
   - Incorporate a **line number gutter** alongside the Markdown editor.
   - **Take inspiration from CodePen’s code editor UI** — aim for a clean, modern, and intuitive editing experience.

5. **Navigation Bar (Desktop View)**  
   Include the following buttons:
   - **File** (Dropdown Menu)  
     - New File (reset content)  
     - Save  
     - Load  
   - **Download** (Dropdown Menu)  
     - Download as `.md`  
     - Download as `.zip`  
   - **Save**  
     - Saves content to localStorage (retained after page reload)
   - **Theme Toggle**  
     - Switches between light and dark modes  
   > *Note:* Each dropdown item must display an icon followed by the text label.

6. **Mobile Navigation (Hamburger Menu)**  
   - Collapse the navigation bar into a **hamburger icon** on mobile.
   - Tapping it should expand a menu with the same options as the desktop view.

7. **Adjustable Tabs**  
   - Make the divider between the **editor** and **preview** **draggable/resizable**.
   - Allow users to adjust the panel sizes, on both desktop and mobile devices.

8. **Responsiveness**  
   - Ensure smooth adaptation across various screen sizes and orientations.
   - Use responsive design principles for seamless performance on all devices.
